Rules are the not-fun part of everything, but they exist for a reason. In the Time Served community, we want to maximize fun for the largest number of people. That often means making some personal sacrifices "for the greater good". That being said, a well-designed game shouldn't require a lot of explicit rules that aren't automatically enforced by the game world. Whenever possible, we will try to keep this list short in favor of creating the proper boundaries within the world itself.

Violation of these rules may result in disciplinary behavior up to and including permanent banning from the community and server. You are not expected to memorize every word on this page, but you **are** expected to exercise common sense.

# General Rules
- Breaking any rules may result in administrative action.
- Not knowing the rules does not make players exempt from them.
- If another player breaks rules it does not give you the right to break a rule yourself.
- Trying to skirt an obvious rule may result in a ban.
- Administrators reserve the right to ban players who they feel are toxic, disruptive, or otherwise negatively impacting the community.
- Minor rules may be superseded by excellent role-play as determined by administrators.
- When all else fails, use common sense.

## Conduct
- You must be 18 or older to play on any of our servers.
- You must have a working microphone. No exceptions
- Racism, bigotry, anti-semitism, and any other form of harassment will not be tolerated.
- Out Of Character personal attacks on any member of the community will not be tolerated.
- Insulting or attacking other communities will not be tolerated.
- Players can not role-play sexual assault, rape, torture, or anything that can be deemed as intense or inappropriate behavior.

## Abuse
- Intentional exploitation of the server or infrastructure is prohibited and will result in an immediate and permanent ban.
- If you find a bug, report it to an administrator. Repeatedly "testing" a bug or sharing knowledge of it with other players is prohibited.
- Aesthetic client-side modifications are allowed as long as they don't provide what could be considered an unfair advantage over another player. For example, map modifications are acceptable. Any modification that adds a crosshair to the screen is prohibited.

## Originality
- Creating characters that are blatant copies of existing intellectual property is prohibited. This includes both real life personalities and well-known fictional characters.
- You may create parodies or "knockoffs" of existing people or characters provided your creation could reasonably qualify as [fair use](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html).
- Failure to adhere to this policy may result in you being asked to rename or delete your character.

# IC vs. OOC
IC (In Character) refers to knowledge or information that your **character** knows.  OOC (Out Of Character) refers to things that you the player know. As a player, you will inevitably know more information than your character. Maintaining a separation between the concepts of IC and OOC is a fundamental part of roleplaying.  If you are deemed incapable of keeping OOC separate from IC, you may be asked to leave the community.

## Roleplaying
- You must roleplay every situation.
	- **Example**: "I ran the stoplight because of server lag" or similar situations is not allowed.
 	- **Exception**:  Players may only go Out Of Character when an administrator asks you to explain a situation and/or authorizes you to go OOC.
- You must value your character's life.
	- **Example**:  If a player has a gun to your head you must act accordingly.
- You may not create a character who has a personal relationship with one of your other characters (no brothers, cousins, aunts, uncles, etc.).
- You may associate with the same people as two different characters, but you must strive to differentiate the nature of those relationships.
	- **Example:** One of your characters is a lawyer and the other is a criminal. Your (OOC) friend also plays a criminal. It's okay for your two criminals to be in the same gang while your lawyer represents your friend's character as an attorney.
- Any medical injuries must be roleplayed appropriately.
- You may not act overtly in front of police officers solely for the purpose of garnering a response. No cop baiting.
- Respawning, logging out, or finding another way to avoid or skirt potential role-play or consequences is prohibited

## Conflict
- Players may not kill or attack other players without roleplay.
- You must have valid In-Character motivations when trying to kill or attack another player.
	- **Example:** "I'm a criminal" is **not** a valid motivation.
- Players may use vehicles as weapons as long as it is reasonable for the roleplay situation.
- Players may only participate in a particular conflict with one character.
	- **Example:** If two gangs are at war and you have a character in both, you may only be a "shooter" on one side or the other.
  - **Example:** Police officers may not contribute to investigations that have any impact on their other character(s).

## Misuse of "/me"
Using "/me" is a way to show physical reactions/descriptions for your character that can't otherwise be shown using current game mechanics. For example, if one broke their arm in the day, you could use "/me Bob has a cast on his arm" or if one fell off their motorcycle and had their face dragged across the asphault, you could use "/me has bad road rash on their face."  It is also heavily used in medical RP and encouraged between medical interactions.

Abusing /me is a form of FailRP and is not permitted on this server. Examples of this are as follows:

- Using /me to show thoughts. If your character is thinking something, no one else would hear it unless it was spoken by your character. You can't use /me to say "/me thinks Burger Bob is a dumbass" but you could use it to show frustration, "/me looks frustrated at Burger Bob." RP is always king, though, so if you could express your frustration through your dialogue, that is preferred.

- Using /me for OOC communication is not allowed UNLESS you are having microphone/audio issues and need to quickly alert those in your scene so you can fix it. You can say "/me has to adjust his earbuds" but you shouldn't continue to communicate OOC in this manner. Please take it to Discord, instead.

We strictly enforce /me rules. Abide by "serious RP" and remember RPing is always preferred, but /me is a great tool to add to RP if used correctly.

## Metagaming
- Communication outside of the game is not to be taken as In-Character information unless explicitly stated otherwise by an administrator.
	- **Exception**: Discord DMs may be used to exchange media (images/clips) for RP purposes (i.e. "email attachments"). However, it **must** be supported by in-game RP and text message records.
  - **Exception**: Discord channels underneath the "In Character" channel group should be treated as in-character.
  - **Exception**: Support tickets opened through Discord *may* be In-Character for the purpose of asking for IC resolution from a Game Master. Think of this as asking for a DM ruling in a D&D session.
- You may not exchange items between two of your characters directly or indirectly, including giving something to a third party for your other character.
- You may not *use* information gathered outside of roleplaying to influence your actions within the game.
- You may not *provide* In Character information to others through any medium outside of the game.
- Knowledge and experience should be learned and discovered by your current character.
	- **Example**: A character who is new to the city should not know about hidden locations just because you (the player) knows.
- Players should take care to roleplay in a manner that allows for others to influence the situation. No "Power Gaming".
- When all else fails, use common sense.

## Recordings
The question often arises as to whether stream/VOD footage may be used for IC purposes. We **do** allow recordings to be used ICly in certain scenarios under specific criteria:
- Video recordings may only be used ICly if it is "reasonable" to expect that the actions in question would have been recorded.
	- **Example:** When robbing a convenience store without wearing a mask, it is reasonable to expect that your face will be captured on security camera footage.
  - **Example:** When murdering a gang rival in the middle of a deserted field, it is not reasonable to expect that you are being recorded.

The question of whether or not something is "reasonable" will be decided by the courts. Video may be submitted as evidence and a judge (or GM) will rule on whether it's usable/admissable based on the circumstances. Here is a non-exhaustive list of factors that are considered to determine whether or not the expectation of being recorded is reasonable:
- Location (convenience store vs. deserted field)
- Presence of an **on-duty and uniformed** police officer. "Body cam" footage may **only** be used if a police officer was present, on duty, and in uniform.
- Actions of other characters in the scene. Are they holding a phone and RPing as if they are recording? Are they using a news camera emote?

The ruling on whether the submitted video can be used may also come with caveats. For example, a judge/GM may rule that a convenience store has cameras, but the audio may not be used because convenience store security systems typically do not record audio.

In summary, in order for "video footage" to be used for any IC purposes, you must have two things: 1) Actual footage from a stream or VOD, and 2) A ruling from a judge or GM that use of the video falls within the expectations of "reasonable".

## Death
Each time your character "dies", they start a new life - all their previous memories are lost. You may not immediately return to the place where your character died, pursue revenge on the person(s) who killed your character, or recall any (IC) information about the events leading up to your character's death. If you have a question about whether something is permissible or not under NLR, consult with a moderator.

- If you are incapacitated but then manage to wake up (or are stabilized), you should continue roleplaying accordingly.
 - If you are killed ("respawn" is prompted), you must "forget" the events leading up to your death.
 - Character death is never permanent unless you choose it.

# The "Win" Mentality
We (the administrators) are here to provide and maintain a virtual world that serves as the backdrop for creative storytelling. Every story has protagonists and antagonists. Every character has a story where they are (usually) the protagonist. It's natural to want your character to "win" in various conflict-based situations, but it's important to understand that you cannot always be the victor in a virtual world where every character is the protagonist of their own story. It is impossible to have an explicit rule against "wanting to win", but be mindful of your actions and whether or not you're creating an environment that other people **want** to roleplay in.

## Interactions with Police
Police officers are ambassadors of roleplay in our community. They have significant IC and OOC responsibilities that reflect the immense power that real police officers have. The power to deprive someone of their rights should not be taken lightly.  In a video game setting, improper use of police powers drains the fun from an otherwise interesting IC conflict. This is a delicate balance, and as game designers we are always mindful of tipping the scales too far one way or the other when it comes to police versus crime.

That being said, everybody makes mistakes, and police officers are no exception. When an officer screws up in the real world, the consequences can be severe. That's why they go through months of training to get their badge followed by years of ongoing education. Our RP cops don't have the benefit of that training, but they're asked to make those same decisions and split second judgment calls (albeit in a game world). If something goes down in a way that seems improper, remember: **Roleplay over rule play**.  Finish the interaction, don't break character, and consider bringing any concerns to a moderator after the fact.

It is important to note that there is **not** a server rule against police corruption within the LSPD and BCSO. However, just like every other character, the police will be held accountible for their IC actions. Corruption (if it's caught) may lead to disciplinary action, firing, or criminal charges.  The SASP are the one police agency explicitly tasked with rooting out corruption within the other departments. All of this to say that if you have a problem with a cop, your recourse should be In-Character if the offense was In-Character. Some asshole cop giving your character a hard time is not against the rules. Go file a complaint with their supervisor.

If every character is the protagonist of their own story, that means our police officer characters often become the antagonists. Keep that in mind. Playing the "bad guy" can get exhausting, but the core of any good story is conflict. Also try to remember that there's a real person behind every character. Regardless of what goes down in the IC world, treat everyone with common OOC courtesy.

## FIB Most Wanted
Occasionally, a criminal will rise to a level of notoriety which ICly garners the attention of the federal authorities. There are no exact criteria for when this happens, but repeatedly and blatantly committing violent felonies with no regard for anything is a great way to get noticed. When this happens, the character's name will be placed on the FIB's Most Wanted list. When a character who is on the Most Wanted list is finally caught and arrested for **any** crime, they will be sentenced to life in federal prison. This is effectively a forced perma-death for the character depending on other circumstances.

A character may be removed from the FIB's Most Wanted list if they start tempering their behavior and acting less conspicuous. In other words, fly under the radar for a while and the FIB will move on to other more important things.

# Shared Immersion
When you play on our server, you implicitly agree to abide by a common understanding of the world. Our characters live in a modern, industrialized world with a technology level equal to early 21st century Earth. There are no dragons.  Magic is not real.  Aliens are a conspiracy theory. People who think otherwise are probably viewed as "eccentric" or just downright crazy. This common understanding of the world is our shared immersion as players.

You are signing an implicit contract to abide by the rules of our shared immersion. You cannot be otherworldly. You are not a time traveler. You do not have superpowers. You can *act* like you do, but you should expect that most people will view you as eccentric or downright crazy.  This is necessary in order to maintain our shared immersion.

## Opting Out
The community and server are both sandboxes for roleplaying. You are encouraged to create your own stories. You are free to be as creative, elaborate, and inventive as you want within the context of your own stories, even if that doesn't necessarily mesh well with our shared immersion. Other players are free to go along with your story if they so choose. However, they are also free to "opt out" if they do not want to break the rules of shared immersion. They can wave your story off as "nonsense" or "crazy" or "a conspiracy theory" if that would be an appropriate reaction for someone with our common understanding of the world.  That is their perogative, and as a story creator you should respect that. The only time this does not apply is if the roleplay was initiated by a Game Master.

If this entire section seems confusing, then you probably don't need to worry about it.

# Discipline
We use a progressive discipline system that typically begins at the lowest level and goes up one step with each subsequent infraction. The disciplinary levels are (in order):
1. Warning
1. 3 Day Ban
1. 7 Day Ban
1. 30 Day Ban
1. Permanent Ban

Administrators may use discretion when moving up to the next level of discipline depending on the player's history within the community. Once someone has been premanently banned, their only recourse is to send an appeal via email to admin@timeservedrp.com no sooner than 30 days after the ban begins.

Prior rule infractions are expunged after six months.  In other words, if you get a warning and then keep your nose clean for 6 months before screwing up again, you'll get another warning instead of a 3-day ban.
