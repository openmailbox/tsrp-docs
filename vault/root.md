# Welcome to Time Served

We are an open source gaming and roleplaying community centered around the FiveM modded server for Grand Theft Auto V. Our mission is to build a truly immersive virtual world that serves as the backdrop for creative storytelling. We accomplish this by building complex simulations that respond to user choice, and we try to balance that by making compromises for engaging gameplay.

Time Served is played through the FiveM modded client for Grand Theft Auto V. It requires a licensed copy of GTA5. We are whitelisted (meaning you must fill out an application to join), 18+, and serious-leaning in terms of roleplay style. Our server is custom-built from scratch with a heavy economy focus.

We are diverse, welcoming, and helpful. Whether you're a veteran with years of RP experience, or a fresh newbie who's never played FiveM before, TSRP can be your home.
