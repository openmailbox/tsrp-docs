<p>Role playing is fun. You can take on a totally different persona and live vicariously in ways you would never imagine in the real world. It's even better when you can share that experience with others. </p>
<p>Multiplayer video games have tried to capitalize on this feeling of shared immersion for years, but MMORPGs always come up short. When you're catering to millions of players, it's impossible to tell a story that feels meaningful to all of them while also maintaining a consistent world fiction. You can't have 10 million main characters in a great story, so instead you have 10 million individuals playing through the same (or slightly varied) story. That story may be great in its own right, but it causes a sort of cognitive dissonance knowing that every other player also had the exact same experience. It breaks the consistency of the fiction in a huge world that is supposedly inhabited by millions of characters.</p>
<p>Players solve this problem by self-organizing into role playing communities. Tools like <a href="https://fivem.net/">FiveM</a> enable those communities to create a shared immersion for players that's more manageable than the millions of participants demanded by MMORPG economics of scale. The results are incredible, and we often see amazing and engaging storytelling coming out of these communities on platforms like Twitch and Youtube.</p>
<p>There is so much potential in this space of community-driven RPGs, and we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg. Even the biggest and most successful communites will never have the resources and knowledge of a AAA game company. Currently, communities compete against each other for player attention in a zero sum game where only the "best" servers rise to the top. These communities often use the exact same (or barely modified/reskinned) code and assets that are either purchased directly from an individual developer, or possibly leaked/stolen from some large community. As a result, RP communities often look like cookie cutter copies of each other with slightly varied rule sets. Innovation is all but dead.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be that way. This current state of affairs arose because server owners optimize for their own commercial success. Everyone wants to make money, and the implied tradeoff discourages collaboration and communication between developers. This is a microcosm of the larger movement toward software privatization, and it's one of the reasons why the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">free and open-source (FOSS) software movement</a> came to exist.</p>
<p>If we apply the principles of the FOSS movement to RP community development, we remove the artificial ceiling. Imagine a world where the best indie modders work with instead of against each other for the benefit of all. The potential is limitless, and incentivization is no longer tied to commercial success. </p>
<p>Perhaps this is an overly idealistic outlook, but it's certainly more appealing than our current cuthroat ecosystem of communities trying to step on each other to reach the top. We propose inverting the current success pyramid that dominates the larger RP server modding community. We will do this by publishing all of our work under a strong copyleft open-source license, and reducing the friction that inherently discourages external contributions. We will not compromise quality for expediency. We will share and share-alike.</p></div></div><div style="padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px" class="ant-col ant-col-xs-0 ant-col-md-6"><div><div class=""><div class="ant-anchor-wrapper dendron-toc" style="max-height:calc(100vh - 64px);z-index:1"><div class="ant-anchor"><div class="ant-anchor-ink"><span class="ant-anchor-ink-ball"></span></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></main><div class="ant-divider ant-divider-horizontal" role="separator"></div><footer class="ant-layout-footer" style="padding:0 24px 24px"></footer></section></section></section></section></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"note":{"id":"413wt8jh2w3qd8l3u1iwzkt","title":"Vision","desc":"Overall community vision.","updated":1656440602710,"created":1656376498007,"custom":{},"fname":"community.vision","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"9efa1df244751fdc6790ed0314b5238e","links":[],"anchors":{},"children":[],"parent":"lpc5yicm2ffwc8ez7o9wx2a","data":{}},"body":"\u003ch1 id=\"vision\"\u003e\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#vision\"\u003e\u003csvg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"\u003e\u003cuse xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"\u003e\u003c/use\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/a\u003eVision\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRole playing is fun.
