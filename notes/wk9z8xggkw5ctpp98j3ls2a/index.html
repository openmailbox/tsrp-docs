<p>Everything produced by the TSRP community is meant to be open-source and governed by the community itself. Even this document describing the mode of governance is itself open-source. If the community collectively decides in the future to move away from this model, so be it.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the community lacks hirearchy or leadership. Members are categorized into one of a few buckets depending on their actions and intent.</p>
<h2 id="users"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#users"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Users</h2>
<p>All community members start as users. Users play on our servers, consume or fork our source code to power their own servers, or otherwise directly benefit from the community's output. There is no expectation that users "give back" in any way. Our community is a labor of love for the greater good, and we genuinely hope that others enjoy, learn from, and enhance the work we started here.</p>
<p>We expect nothing of users, and thus users should expect nothing from us. We are the contributors and maintainers of the community. Our most finite and valuable resource is time, and we guard it dearly. We preemptively apologize for suboptimal user experiences. Code has bugs. Things may not work as you want them to. Other people might be assholes. These things happen, and while we do our best to moderate and regulate the experience for all users, we also know the futility of trying to make everyone happy.</p>
<p>Instead, we want to empower users to solve their own problems by becoming contributors.</p>
<h2 id="contributors"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#contributors"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Contributors</h2>
<p>Contributors are users who give something back to the community. A contribution can be anything. Here is a non-exhaustive list of example contributions ordered by scope from small to large:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organize an in-game event for other players.</li>
<li>Fix a typo in this document.</li>
<li>Add a new page to our docs collection explaining how something works in the game.</li>
<li>Test a new WIP feature for a developer on our test server.</li>
<li>Fix a bug that was reported in an issue on one of our code repos.</li>
<li>Add a new feature to our website.</li>
<li>Propose and develop an entirely new game system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything we do as a community is open-source, meaning most of these examples may be accomplished by opening <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">pull requests</a> against the appropriate repository.</p>
<p>Please note that none of these contributions involve money. The financial aspects of supporting the community will be discussed elsewhere, but in the context of this document we are <em>not</em> referring to monetary donations.</p>
<p>Contributors invest in the community, and are therefore incentivized to maintain our standards. We treat reports of suboptimal user experiences with greater weight when they come from fellow contributors. The amount of influence a contributor brings to the table correlates with the scope of their contributions. We cannot make everyone happy, and therefore in matters of conflict we prefer to support our largest contributors.</p>
<p>However, that does not give contributors a free pass to break <a href="http://docs.timeservedrp.com/notes/jijyxirooej95u09sy0aelv/">rules</a>. In disciplinary matters involving contributors, community maintainers have the final say. When a contributor establishes themselves as a community leader and demonstrates qualities that align with our core vision, they may be asked to become a maintainer.</p>
<h2 id="maintainers"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#maintainers"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Maintainers</h2>
<p>Maintainers keep the community moving forward. They review and merge pull requests, deploy new versions of software across our servers and applications, arbitrate disagreements involving contributors, and otherwise attempt to steer the ship. They are trusted to make decisions that are good for the community over the individuals.</p>
<p>All maintainers were and are also contributors, but being a maintainer comes with actual responsibilities to the community. The job is often thankless. Typically, contributors do the "fun" tasks and maintainers are left to handle the housekeeping. Maintainers are also the smallest of the three member groups. Out of 100 members, we would hope to find about 20 contributors with perhaps 5 maintainers. The rest are users.</p></div></div><div style="padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px" class="ant-col ant-col-xs-0 ant-col-md-6"><div><div class=""><div class="ant-anchor-wrapper dendron-toc" style="max-height:calc(100vh - 64px);z-index:1"><div class="ant-anchor"><div class="ant-anchor-ink"><span class="ant-anchor-ink-ball"></span></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#users" title="Users">Users</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#contributors" title="Contributors">Contributors</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#maintainers" title="Maintainers">Maintainers</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></main><div class="ant-divider ant-divider-horizontal" role="separator"></div><footer class="ant-layout-footer" style="padding:0 24px 24px"></footer></section></section></section></section></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"note":{"id":"wk9z8xggkw5ctpp98j3ls2a","title":"Governance","desc":"","updated":1656805985962,"created":1656435021823,"custom":{},"fname":"community.governance","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"610f8b32ec701afc6ffe483a7c24f1ec","links":[],"anchors":{"users":{"type":"header","text":"Users","value":"users","line":11,"column":0,"depth":2},"contributors":{"type":"header","text":"Contributors","value":"contributors","line":18,"column":0,"depth":2},"maintainers":{"type":"header","text":"Maintainers","value":"maintainers","line":36,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":[],"parent":"lpc5yicm2ffwc8ez7o9wx2a","data":{}},"body":"\u003ch1 id=\"governance\"\u003e\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#governance\"\u003e\u003csvg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"\u003e\u003cuse xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"\u003e\u003c/use\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/a\u003eGovernance\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything produced by the TSRP community is meant to be open-source and governed by the community itself.
