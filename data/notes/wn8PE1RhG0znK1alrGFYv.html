<p>We are an open source role playing game and community based on Grand Theft Auto V. We use the popular <a href="https://fivem.net/">FiveM</a> modification as a starting point, and we layer our own code on top. Our mission is to build a truly immersive virtual world that is wholly governed by players, and which serves as the backdrop for creative storytelling.</p>
<p>Playing on TSRP requires a licensed copy of GTA5. We are an 18+ community. Please review our <a href="http://docs.timeservedrp.com/notes/jijyxirooej95u09sy0aelv/">game and community rules</a> at your earliest convenience. Ignorance is not an excuse.</p>
<p>We are diverse, welcoming, and helpful. Whether you're a veteran with years of RP experience, or a fresh newbie who's never played FiveM before, TSRP can be your home.</p>
